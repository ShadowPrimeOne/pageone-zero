## Priority Optimization Actions

### 🚨 Critical (Immediate Impact)
1. **Image Optimization**
   - Convert all images to WebP format ✅
   - Implement proper image sizing and compression
   - Add lazy loading for below-fold images
   - Use responsive images with srcset

2. **JavaScript Optimization**
   - Reduce bundle size through code splitting
   - Implement critical CSS inlining
   - Defer non-critical JavaScript
   - Optimize React component rendering

3. **Server Performance**
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Optimize database queries
   - Use CDN for static assets
   - Enable compression (gzip/brotli)

### ⚠️ High Priority (Significant Impact)
4. **CSS Optimization**
   - Remove unused CSS
   - Inline critical CSS
   - Minimize CSS bundle size
   - Use CSS containment

5. **Font Optimization**
   - Use system fonts where possible
   - Implement font-display: swap
   - Preload critical fonts
   - Subset fonts to required characters

6. **Third-party Script Management**
   - Audit and remove unnecessary third-party scripts
   - Load non-critical scripts asynchronously
   - Implement resource hints (preconnect, dns-prefetch)

### 📈 Medium Priority (Performance Gains)
7. **Animation Optimization**
   - Reduce animation complexity on mobile
   - Use CSS transforms instead of layout changes
   - Implement reduced motion preferences
   - Optimize animation timing

8. **Component Optimization**
   - Implement React.memo for expensive components
   - Use useCallback and useMemo strategically
   - Optimize re-render cycles
   - Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
