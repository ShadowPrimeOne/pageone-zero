## Session Start
**Date:** [To be filled]

### Phase 1: Design System Foundation âœ… COMPLETED
- Design system foundation (color palette, tokens, scalable variables) is set up in `globals.css`.

- Added card system for consistent content containers
- Added form input styling with focus states
- Added loading states and responsive utilities
- All components are mobile-first with proper touch targets
- Accessibility features included (focus states, reduced motion support)

### Phase 3: Apply Modern Styles to Existing Components âœ… COMPLETED
**Completed:**
1. âœ… **ModuleWrapper buttons** - Updated all control buttons (move up/down, edit, duplicate, delete, add module)
2. âœ… **AddModuleModal buttons** - Updated close button, category selectors, and template CTA buttons
3. âœ… **SaveButton** - Updated floating save button with modern styling
4. âœ… **FloatingPublishButton** - Updated publish button with modern styling
5. âœ… **Hero Modules** - Updated ClassicOverlayHero and TopImageCenterTextHero with full-screen backgrounds using `100dvh`

**Next Steps:**
1. **Update modal components** (SaveModal, PublishModal, EditModuleModal, etc.)
2. **Update form buttons** (ContactFormModule, FormModule)
3. **Update module CTA buttons** (Hero2Module buttons)
4. **Enhance module containers** with new card system

**Testing Points:**
- âœ… Test module control buttons on both desktop and mobile
- âœ… Verify "Add Module" button works correctly
- âœ… Confirm save and publish buttons are properly styled
- âœ… Test hero modules with full-screen backgrounds
- ðŸ”„ Test modal functionality with new button styles
- ðŸ”„ Verify form submissions work correctly
- ðŸ”„ Check that all interactive elements have proper focus states

**Note:** All changes will be incremental and within system limits to ensure smooth progress and easy testing.

### Phase 4: Bug Fixes and Improvements âœ… COMPLETED
**Issues Fixed:**
1. âœ… **Contrast Issues** - Improved text visibility in:
   - Hero2Module CTA buttons: Increased background opacity from `bg-white/10` to `bg-white/20` and added `backdrop-blur-sm`
   - ContactFormModule input fields: Increased background opacity from `bg-white/5` to `bg-white/10` and improved border contrast
   - Added better visual feedback with `backdrop-blur-sm` for modern glass effect

2. âœ… **Module Template Error Handling** - Enhanced error reporting in `fetchModuleTemplateById`:
   - Added comprehensive error logging with template ID, error details, and hints
   - Added try-catch wrapper for unexpected errors
   - Improved error messages for debugging database connection issues

3. âœ… **Full-Screen Hero Backgrounds** - Updated hero modules:
   - ClassicOverlayHero: Added `100dvh` height and proper full-screen background handling
   - TopImageCenterTextHero: Added `100dvh` height and improved image handling
   - Both modules now properly fill the entire viewport on mobile and desktop

**Technical Notes:**
- TypeScript type compatibility issues remain in ModuleWrapper due to conflicting `_tempFile` type definitions
- These are complex type system issues that require broader refactoring
- Core functionality remains intact despite type warnings

### Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Current Focus:**
- Testing full-screen hero module functionality
- Verifying mobile responsiveness
- Checking modal interactions
- Validating form submissions
- Testing save/publish workflows

**Testing Results & Fixes Applied:**
