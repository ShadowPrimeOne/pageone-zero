# Session Log: HERO Module, Editing, Publishing & Re-Editing (2025-06-20)

## Overview
This session focused on stabilizing and enhancing the HERO module experience in a Next.js 15 project, including editing, publishing, and re-editing flows. The work included major bug fixes, performance improvements, and documentation for future maintainers.

---

## Key Accomplishments
- **Stable Editing, Publishing, and Re-Editing**: The HERO module can now be created, edited, published, and re-edited reliably.
- **Next.js 15 Compatibility**: All dynamic routes and API handlers now properly await `params` as required by Next.js 15.
- **Performance Improvements**: Removed all unnecessary `console.log` statements and fixed blob URL memory leaks.
- **Layout & CTA Controls**: Added vertical positioning and CTA alignment controls to the editor and HERO modules.
- **API Routing Fixes**: Corrected publish and page API endpoints, and added `/api/pages/[slug]` for public page access.
- **Direct DB Access in Server Components**: Page rendering now fetches and decrypts data directly from the database, avoiding fetch issues in server components.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Improved error handling and validation throughout the flow.

## Major Changes (Chronological)
1. **Editor & HERO Module Enhancements**
   - Added vertical positioning and CTA alignment controls in `EditModuleModal` and HERO components.
   - Improved layout flexibility for HERO modules.

2. **Performance & Dev Mode Fixes**
   - Removed all `console.log` statements from components and utilities.
   - Fixed blob URL memory leaks with proper cleanup using `useRef` and `useEffect`.
   - Result: No more infinite reloads or slow dev mode.

3. **API & Routing Fixes**
   - Fixed publish endpoint from `/api/publish` to `/api/publishPage`.
   - Added `/api/pages/[slug]` route to fetch published pages by slug, decrypt modules, and return JSON.
   - Ensured all API and page routes use awaited `params` for Next.js 15 compatibility.

4. **Page Rendering Reliability**
   - Updated `[slug]/page.tsx` to fetch and decrypt page data directly from the database, mirroring API logic.
   - Eliminated reliance on fetch for server components, preventing hydration and data issues.

5. **Type Safety & Linting**
   - Fixed type errors related to background types and temporary file metadata.
   - Cleaned up unused imports and variables (remaining linter warnings are non-blocking).

6. **End-to-End Publishing Flow**
   - Slug checking, publishing, image upload, encryption, database save, and public page loading are all stable.
   - Pages can be re-edited and re-published without data loss or corruption.

## Developer/Agent Handoff Notes
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/publishPage`: Publishes a page (expects encrypted modules, slug, etc.)
  - `/api/pages/[slug]`: Returns published page data by slug (decrypts modules)
  - `/api/checkSlug`: Checks if a slug is available
- **Dynamic Page Route**:
  - `/page/[slug]`: Renders published page using direct DB access and decryption
- **HERO Module**:
  - Supports vertical positioning, CTA alignment, and flexible layouts
  - All placeholder and default text logic is robust
- **Blob/Image Handling**:
  - Uses `useRef` and `useEffect` for cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Next.js 15**:
  - All dynamic routes and API handlers use `params: Promise<{ slug: string }>` and `await params`
- **.env.local**:
  - Should contain all required Supabase and app URL variables (already present and working)
- **Known Warnings**:
  - Some linter warnings remain (unused vars, exhaustive deps), but do not block builds or functionality

---

## How to Continue
- To add new modules, follow the HERO module pattern for layout and controls.
- For new API endpoints, ensure you use awaited `params` in Next.js 15.
- For performance, avoid unnecessary logs and always clean up resources (e.g., blob URLs).
- For publishing, always check slug availability and handle encryption/decryption as in the current flow.
