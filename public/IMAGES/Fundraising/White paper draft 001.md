### ***Confidential Investment Brief — Pre-Seed Round (Private)***

**Date:** July 2025  
 **Version:** 1.0  
 **Prepared by:** Travis Cunningham (Founder, PageOne)  
 **Contact:** tcunningham2610@gmail.com | \+61 411 070 473

---

**🔹 Executive Summary**

**PageOne** is a scalable, human-powered digital marketing platform for local businesses that combines mobile-first landing pages, automated Google & Meta ad campaigns, and integrated lead capture and follow-up — all guided by trained local ambassadors. We simplify the entire marketing journey into a done-for-you system that replaces today's fragmented approach with a unified funnel.

Most SMEs use disconnected tools that are too complex, too slow, or too expensive. PageOne differentiates through a unified, human-guided funnel where ambassadors earn both upfront and recurring income as micro-franchise partners, not traditional sales reps. The platform was bootstrapped to MVP but needs capital to scale due to constraints on ad spend, data, and onboarding velocity.

**PageOne is building the future of fast, affordable, and localised digital marketing — powered by people, amplified by automation.**

**🔧 Current Status**

* MVP 80% complete (tech built, flow tested)
* First client markets identified
* Ambassador system playbooks, UI, and brand ready for rollout

**🎯 Raise**

* Seeking **AUD $30,000–$100,000** in private pre-seed capital
* Funds will complete MVP, onboard 10–20 ambassadors, and launch the first 50–100 clients

### **❗ The Problem**

#### **📉 The Digital Divide Is Real**

Most local businesses are losing leads they never knew they had.

A potential customer searches for a local dentist, mechanic, or accountant — but finds outdated listings, broken websites, or no presence at all. They click the next option. Sale lost. Reputation dented. Revenue is down.

This isn't rare. It's systemic.

**Despite billions spent on online ads each year, most SMEs still struggle with the basics:**

* **Their websites aren't mobile-friendly or optimized for conversion**
* **Their ads are either not running, or running inefficiently** 
* **They lack tools to follow up with leads**
* **They don't have time, training, or staff to manage any of it**

**The data is clear:**

* **80% of Australian SMEs "are not realising their digital potential"** — *Deloitte & Small Business Research Report*
* **35% of US small businesses still don't have a website** — *Top Design Firms 2023 Survey*
* **60–80% of SMEs globally still operate with little or no online lead capture** — *PageOne internal research + verified industry stats*

In a mobile-first world, digital presence equals economic opportunity — and most small businesses are still playing catch-up.

#### **🧠 The Psychology Behind the Problem**

We've worked with hundreds of small businesses. Here's what they consistently say:

* **"I don't know where to start."**
* **"I'm not technical — I just want someone to do it for me."**
* **"I paid someone once and got burned."**
* **"I tried those tools… they were too complicated."**

**They're not lazy. They're overloaded.**

SMEs wear 10 hats a day. Building a lead funnel isn't on their radar until it's too late. And even when they do spend — often thousands on ads — they don't have a proper landing page, or tracking, or follow-up, which makes the spend inefficient and discouraging.

**The result? Churn, wasted time, lost leads, low morale.** Most SMEs just give up and go back to referrals or word-of-mouth — missing out on the 28% revenue boost that comes from a strong digital presence.

#### **🧩 Fragmentation = Failure**

**Let's break down what an SME typically faces:**

| Goal | Common Tool | Problem |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Get a website** | **Wix / Squarespace / Wordpress** | **DIY complexity, poor mobile optimization** |
| **Run ads** | **Google / Meta Ads** | **No help with targeting, copy, or conversion** |
| **Capture leads** | **Forms / Calendars** | **Disconnected from CRM or follow-up** |
| **Follow up** | **Email/SMS tools** | **Requires setup, automations, and integration know-how** |
| **Measure results** | **Analytics dashboards** | **Overwhelming and unclear metrics** |

**Each piece requires separate setup, skills, and time — so most businesses never connect the funnel.**

The result? **Wasted spend. Missed leads. Growth left to chance.**

---

### **✅ The Solution**

PageOne replaces weeks of marketing setup with **a single ambassador-led intake**:

1. Business is onboarded by a local PageOne Ambassador

2. Smart automation assembles a high-converting mobile landing page instantly

3. Google Ads, GMB, Google and Apple Maps, Meta, and Microsoft campaigns go live

4. Leads are captured and followed up via SMS and email

5. Performance improves over time through system-wide optimization

6. This all happens within hours — not weeks — and businesses see results within days.

### 

### 

### 

### **📈 The Opportunity**

Globally, there are **hundreds of millions of service-based SMEs**, most underserved by tech. In Australia alone, **3.3 million** small businesses account for **99% of the market**, but over **80% underperform digitally**.  
 Digital adoption is no longer optional — it’s survival.

PageOne unlocks this market with a frictionless system that empowers:

* **Entrepreneurs** → to launch sites and campaigns without touching a CMS

* **Ambassadors** → to earn from onboarding clients in their local area

* **Businesses** → to get real results from day one, without hiring an agency

---

### 

### **💸 Business Model**

* **Setup Fee**: AUD $500–$1,000

* **Ad Spend Management Fee**: 15–20% of monthly ad budget

* **Add-Ons**: CRM tools, SMS marketing, call tracking

* **Ambassadors**: Earn commission from both setup and recurring spend

Revenue is fast, recurring, and scales cleanly with ambassador growth.

---

### 

### **🛠️ Current Status**

* MVP in final development phase (tested endpoints, UI/UX in development)

* Active ambassador playbooks, branding, UI, and system diagrams complete

* First clients and pilot markets scoped for Q3 launch

* Platform is fully modular and built for global rollout

### **📉 The Digital Divide Is Crippling Small Businesses**

**Every day, small business owners lose leads they never knew existed.**

**A potential customer searches for a local dentist, mechanic, or accountant — but finds outdated listings, broken websites, or no presence at all. They click the next option. Sale lost. Reputation dented. Revenue is down.**

**This isn’t rare. It’s systemic.**

### **🔢 The Data: A Massive, Measurable Gap**

* **80% of Australian SMEs “are not realising their digital potential”**  
   **— *Deloitte & Small Business Research Report*PageOne\_Executive\_Summa…**

* **Over 3 million Australian businesses are small or micro-sized (less than 20 staff)**  
   **— *ABS Business Counts 2023***

* **35% of US small businesses still don’t have a website**  
   **— *Top Design Firms 2023 Survey***

* **60–80% of SMEs globally still operate with little or no online lead capture**  
   **— *PageOne internal research \+ verified industry stats***

* **Customers prefer mobile: over 90% of local service searches happen on phones**  
   **— *Think with Google (Mobile Behavior Study)***

**“A strong online presence can increase small business revenue by up to 28%.”**  
 **— *GoDaddy State of Small Business Digital Adoption, 2022***

### **🧠 The Psychology: Why the Gap Persists**

**We’ve worked with hundreds of small businesses. Here’s what they consistently say:**

* **“I don’t know where to start.”**

* **“I’m not technical — I just want someone to do it for me.”**

* **“I paid someone once and got burned.”**

### **⚠️ Fragmented Tools ≠ A Working System**

**Let’s break down what an SME typically faces:**

| Goal | Common Tool | Problem |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Get a website** | **Wix / Squarespace? Wordpress / Go Daddy** | **DIY complexity, poor mobile optimization** |
| **Run ads** | **Google / Meta Ads** | **No help with targeting, copy, or conversion** |
| **Capture leads** | **Forms / Calendars** | **Disconnected from CRM or follow-up** |
| **Follow up** | **Email/SMS tools** | **Requires setup, automations, and integration know-how** |
| **Measure results** | **Analytics dashboards** | **Overwhelming and unclear metrics** |

**The result? Frustration. Waste. Churn.**

 **Most end up relying on referrals, word-of-mouth, or untracked phone calls — leaving growth to chance.**

---

### 

### **💡 The Market Is Ripe — But No One’s Closing the Loop**

**There’s no shortage of marketing tools. What’s missing is:**

* **A single touch onboarding flow that turns raw info into a live funnel**

* **A mobile-first landing page that loads instantly and actually converts**

* **Ads written, launched, and optimised without human bottlenecks**

* **A local person who can explain, support, and care**

**PageOne doesn’t build another dashboard. We replace the whole broken funnel with one that works out-of-the-box — and put a real human on the ground to help businesses grow.**

## **🌍 Section 5: Market Opportunity & Competitive Landscape**

### 🌍 Market Opportunity & Competitive Landscape

#### 🌍 The Global Underserved Majority

“There are over 400 million small businesses globally — most still lack a working digital presence.”

PageOne targets local, service-based SMEs in health, trades, legal, education, and consulting — businesses that rely on trust, visibility, and inbound lead generation. These owners are frustrated by complexity, high agency costs, and tools that don’t work together.

#### 📊 TAM Snapshot: AU, UK, US

| **Region**   | **SMEs** | **Annual Ad Spend** | **Digital Gap**                            |
|--------------|----------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Australia    | 3.3M     | $5–10B AUD         | 80% underperforming digitally *(Deloitte)* |
| UK           | 5.5M     | £20B+              | 50% lack effective online presence *(FSB)* |
| USA          | 33.3M    | $300B+             | 35% still lack a website *(GoDaddy)*       |

Even capturing a small % of these markets yields strong recurring revenue — and the playbook replicates globally.

#### 📈 Why Now

- Mobile-first “near me” search dominates service discovery
- Google Business Profiles & Meta pages are primary visibility platforms
- Post-COVID digitization push for SMEs
- Governments offering digitization incentives (e.g., Australia’s Digital Solutions grant)
- AI + automation make done-for-you funnels viable for micro-businesses

## 

## **💸 Section 6: Business Model & Monetization Plan**

### **🧠 Core Philosophy**

**PageOne is built on a simple truth:**

 **And ambassadors don’t want jobs — they want income and impact.**

**We monetize the entire outcome stack — from setup to success — and align every dollar of revenue with value created for the business and the person who helped them get online.**

---

### 

### **💰 Revenue Streams**

| **Hosting & Domains** | **Branded domains with SSL and performance hosting** | **Billed monthly or annually** |
| **Referral Credits** | **Clients refer peers; ambassadors get bonus commissions** | **Organic growth channel** |

**This structure creates a profitable day-one cashflow engine with long-term recurring value and minimal support overhead.**

| **3-Year LTV** | **Sustained ads \+ upgrades** | **$6,000–8,000+ AUD** |

**Setup fees fund growth. Ad margins and upsells create ongoing revenue.**  
 **No code, no team scale needed — this model grows with people.**

## **The Ambassador System: Human Growth at Scale**

**PageOne ambassadors are trained digital reps who build, grow, and manage local portfolios of real-world businesses.**  
 **They’re not salespeople — they’re local growth partners with recurring revenue, client ownership, and real autonomy.**

### **🔄 2-Layer Earning Structure**

#### **1\. Upfront Commission (Hunter Mode)**

* **Paid from setup fee on every new client**

* **Avg. payout: $150–$300 AUD per signup**

#### **2\. Residual Monthly Income (Farmer Mode)**

* **Earn 10–15% of PageOne’s ad margin per client**

* **Avg. payout: $30–$50 AUD per month per active client**

**Ambassadors start earning from day one — and build recurring income over time.**

---

### **🎯 3 Ambassador Styles**

| Style | Focus | Traits | Income Profile |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Hunter** | **New signups** | **Energetic, growth-focused** | **High cashflow via setup commissions** |
| **Farmer** | **Client management** | **Trust-building, service-led** | **Stable residuals via monthly earnings** |
| **Hybrid** | **Both** | **Balanced & scalable** | **Long-term portfolio income \+ fast cash** |

**Most hunters evolve into farmers — earning more by maintaining fewer, higher-value clients.**

---

### 

### 

### **🪙 Ambassador Portfolio Value**

**Each client becomes an income-generating digital asset:**

* **Pays out monthly ad margin**

* **Upgradeable with CRM, hosting, and add-ons**

* **Verified visibility tracked and rewarded**

* **Part of the ambassador’s dashboard-managed book**

**In future releases, ambassadors can:**

* **Sell or transfer accounts to other reps or agencies**

* **Exit with a payout for high-performing portfolios**

* **Earn passive income by retaining oversight only**

**It’s not just a side hustle — it’s a scalable micro-business model with real equity and local value.**

---

### **📆 Income Potential by Role**

| Scenario | Clients Onboarded/Month | Active Clients Year-End | Upfront Income | Monthly Residual | Total Annual Estimate |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Conservative** | **2** | **\~20** | **$3,600–6,000** | **$6,000–9,000** | **$10,000–15,000 AUD** |
| **Core Performer** | **5** | **\~50** | **$9,000–15,000** | **$15,000–25,000** | **$30,000–45,000 AUD** |
| **Top Ambassador** | **10** | **\~100** | **$18,000–30,000** | **$36,000–50,000+** | **$60,000–80,000+ AUD** |

| **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)** | **$0 (covered by setup fee)** |
| **Gross Margin (Setup)** | **\~70–85%** |
| **Gross Margin (Ad Margin)** | **\~65–75% after ambassador payout** |
| **Break-even per ambassador** | **3–4 active clients** |
| **LTV/CAC Ratio** | **\>3:1 from Day 1; 6–8:1 long-term** |
| **Upsell-Driven LTV Boost** | **\+30–60% per client** |

**The business grows through real outcomes — not endless churn or tool fatigue.**

## **🧭 Summary**

**PageOne makes money when small businesses win — and ensures people on the ground are rewarded for helping them.**

**We’ve built:**

* **A profitable onboarding engine**

* **A recurring revenue system that scales with rep volume**

* **A people-powered, quality-controlled growth model**

* **And a real opportunity for thousands of digital reps to earn residual income with real local impact**

**Every PageOne client is a funnel. Every ambassador is a business. And every dollar is earned by delivering visibility, leads, and growth**

**🚀 Section 7: Go-To-Market Strategy & Ambassador Expansion**

### **🎯 Launch Strategy: Led by Humans, Powered by Product**

**PageOne launches with three key assets already in motion:**

1. **Live, industry-specific landing page templates that are mobile-optimized and ad-ready**

2. **A young, US-based ambassador actively onboarding clients and providing feedback**

3. **A committed founding team already preparing direct lead gen campaigns via Google Ads**

**We’re not waiting to scale — we’re actively generating leads, closing deals, and refining the system in real time.**

---

### 

### 

### 

### 

### **📍 Phase 1: AU / UK / US Launch**

| Region | Why Now | Launch Strategy Highlights |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Australia** | **Home base, strong SME network, ad-literate** | **Founder-led onboarding \+ Google Ads pilot** |
| **United Kingdom** | **Fragmented service market, underserved** | **Early ambassador outreach \+ referral leads** |
| **United States** | **Massive volume \+ test ambassador in place** | **Youth-led digital rep model \+ live funnel test** |

**Each market will begin with real ad campaigns, real client onboarding, and live ambassador support — not cold outreach or dashboards.**

---

###     **🧩 Channel Strategy**

| Channel | Purpose | Execution |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Direct Google Ads** | **Generate leads for real onboarding** | **Built, funded, and managed in-house** |
| **Ambassador-Led Outreach** | **Build local presence and close deals** | **Face-to-face and remote across AU, UK, US** |
| **Test Partner Program** | **Get live results \+ testimonials** | **Offered during pre-seed, fully serviced** |
| **Referral Loops** | **Drive new ambassadors & clients** | **Tracked via dashboard** |

**Our own Google Ads campaigns serve as both lead acquisition and training data — we are our first use case.**

---

### 

### 

### **🎁 Pre-Seed as GTM: Gifted Campaign Credits**

**Investors and supporters during the pre-seed round have the option to gift part of their investment as campaign credit to a small business of their choice.**

**This accomplishes:**

* **Real marketing spend deployed to real SMEs**

* **Early traction and revenue**

* **Social value from supporting local businesses**

* **Expanded ambassador and client network via gifting**

**One investor \= one new client. One gifted campaign \= a visible, grateful SME. It’s goodwill that grows the network.**

---

### 

### **🧭 Real-World Deployment, Not a Waiting List**

| Launch Resource | Status |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Industry Templates** | **Live: tradies, legal, finance** |
| **Ad Funnels** | **Running: AU \+ US Google Ads** |
| **First Ambassadors** | **Active in US \+ AU** |
| **Founder Capacity** | **Actively onboarding and selling** |
| **Feedback Loop** | **Live testing \+ iteration** |

**This isn’t an idea being pitched — it’s a system being used.**

---

### 

### 

### **🎓 Ambassador Onboarding Kit**

**Every ambassador receives:**

* **Their own campaign-ready landing page**

* **CRM \+ dashboard login**

* **Prebuilt ad templates, case studies, scripts**

* **Visibility-based incentive system (GMB \+ campaign scores)**

* **Income projection tools and optional lead handoff channels**

**Reps can go from sign-up to selling in under 48 hours.**

---

**♻️ The Growth Flywheel**

**`🎯 Ambassador signs up →`**

**`📲 Uses landing page + ad funnel →`**

**`💼 Onboards 1st SME →`**

**`📍 Verifies GMB/Maps presence →`**

**`📈 Client gets leads →`**

**`💬 Client refers others →`**

**`🧑‍💼 Ambassador gains clients or recruits next rep`**

**This self-scaling loop is human-led, digitally supported, and compensation-aligned from day one.**

---

### **🔄 Micro-Territory Model**

* **Ambassadors operate in geographic or vertical niches**

* **They are incentivized to retain and upsell their client base**

* **Over time, they may sell their book, hand it off, or graduate to regional leadership**

**PageOne doesn’t require mass hiring. It grows ambassador by ambassador, area by area — a local-first play with national-scale potential.**

---

### **🧭 Summary**

**PageOne’s go-to-market is already alive.**

* **We’re onboarding clients.**

* **We’re running ads.**

* **We’re testing in the field.**

* **We’re building a human-powered growth loop that improves with each new business we help.**

**With pre-seed support, we don’t just get funding — we turn investors into network activators, SMEs into success stories, and ambassadors into digital income earners.**

**🧭 Section 8: Traction & Roadmap**

### **⚙️ Current Status: Pre-Revenue, Post-Product**

**PageOne is not yet a registered company and has no paying clients at this moment. We’ve consciously delayed formal launch to ensure:**

* **The product is built to spec**

* **The monetization is tested internally**

* **The team is trained on delivery**

* **The system is robust enough to scale with humans, not chaos**

**We are ready for controlled rollout — not premature exposure.**

---

### 

### 

### 

### **🔧 What’s Built and Ready**

| Area | Status |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Dynamic landing pages** | **✅ Built and vertically specific** |
| **GMB \+ Maps verification API** | **✅ Integrated and staged for onboarding** |
| **Funnel automation & CRM** | **✅ Connected, tested, internally stable** |
| **Ambassador dashboard (v1)** | **✅ Live with tracking and bonus mechanics** |
| **Realistic UX testing** | **✅ Complete with dummy SMEs and lead flows** |

**We’ve executed internal dry runs of the full funnel: from landing page to verification, ad trigger to CRM, and ambassador commission logic to dashboard badge alerts.**

---

### **🎁 Pre-Seed Use of Funds \= Focused First Traction**

**Your investment activates:**

* **Company formation \+ legal setup**

* **AdWords launch (founder-led \+ test ambassadors)**

* **First 3 ambassador activations**

* **CRM and dashboard hardening**

* **Campaign credit gifting (investors → SMEs)**

* **Partner onboarding \+ feedback cycle**

**This first $30K–$100K AUD isn’t speculative. It’s mapped to tangible outputs, SME impact, and ambassador income.**

---

###   **🛠️ Traction-by-Design Strategy**

**We aim to demonstrate functional, profitable growth — not vanity metrics or PR cycles.**

**Our traction model is built on:**

| Milestone Target | Strategy |
| ----- | ----- |
| **First 30 clients** | **Founder \+ direct Google Ads** |
| **400 to 600 Clients Yr 1** | **Internal ads \+ ambassador conversion** |
| **Ambassador onboarding** | **1 new rep per month (3 regions)** |
| **SME verification rate** | **\>90% fully listed by ambassador assist** |
| **Rep monetization** | **Immediate setup fee \+ residual income** |

**By month 3, the system should be showing live revenue, retained clients, and trackable regional growth — even at modest volume.**

---

**📊 What Success Looks Like, Year 1 (Realistically Modeled)**

| Metric | Target (Month 12\) | Basis |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Ambassadors active** | **12+ (1 per month avg.)** | **Across AU, UK, US** |
| **Active regions** | **9–12 (city or sub-region basis)** | **Each tied to 1 rep or pod** |
| **New clients per month** | **\~30 by Month 6; \~60/month by Month 12** | **1/day scale model** |
| **Total SMEs launched** | **\~500+ in 12 months** | **1,000 is stretch goal** |
| **Avg. revenue per SME (Year 1\)** | **$2,000–$3,500 AUD** | **Based on setup \+ ad margin** |
| **Total annual revenue** | **\~$1M–$1.5M AUD** | **Across all sources (gross)** |
| **Gross margin (year avg)** | **\~70%** | **After ambassador payments** |
| **Operating profit (before founder pay)** | **\~$500K–$800K AUD** | **Lean cost structure** |

---

###         

### **🔄 Month-by-Month Projection (First 12 Months)**

| Month | Ambassadors | Clients Onboarded | Cumulative Revenue (AUD est.) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1** | **1 (founder)** | **5–10** | **$5K–$10K** |
| **2** | **2** | **15–20** | **$15K–$25K** |
| **3** | **3** | **30+** | **$30K+** |
| **6** | **6** | **150+** | **$250K+** |
| **12** | **12+** | **500–600+** | **$1M–$1.5M** |

**These figures are achievable without VC burn or mass hires. Every ambassador makes money. Every client pays to enter. Every dollar funds growth.**

---

### **💎 Traction Differentiator: High-Trust, High-Impact Launch**

**Unlike other startups:**

* **We don’t need to hit scale to prove value — every rep who earns, proves the model**

* **Every client is visible, verifiable, and ROI-tracked via GMB and campaign flows**

* **Early adopters (investors, SMEs, ambassadors) are built into the growth flywheel**

---

###  **📌 Summary**

**We are pre-revenue — but ready to switch it on.**

* **We’ve earned zero so far. But the system is designed to generate revenue before equity burn**

* **We’ve onboarded no real clients — but we know who they are and how to get them**

* **We don’t have a huge team — because our model pays people for growth, not payroll**

**This isn’t a hype cycle — it’s a go-live moment. All we need is the fuel.**

## **🧑‍🚀 Section 9: Founder & Team**

### **🎙️ Meet the Founder: Travis Cunningham**

**Founder, PageOne**  
 **Digital builder. SME specialist. Human-scale automation advocate.**

---

### 

### 

### 

### 

### **🧩 A Nonlinear Path to Purpose**

**Travis Cunningham left school early and built his career from the ground up — across banking, sales, solar, service, and small business marketing.**

* **He founded ARDigital, a regional agency serving Australian SMEs**

* **Built high-performing websites and ad campaigns by hand**

* **Worked with hundreds of business owners face-to-face**

* **Learned by doing — and by listening**

**But the real turning point came during a global sabbatical — 18 months spent traveling through Africa, Southeast Asia, and Europe, reflecting on the digital economy and his own future.**

**“I started building websites and realised something uncomfortable — if I didn’t automate my own job, someone else would. And when they did, I might be cut out of the income entirely.”**

**That realisation sparked PageOne:**  
 **A platform that doesn’t just build pages — it builds opportunity.**  
 **For freelancers. For SMEs. For anyone who wants to be part of the solution.**

---

### 

### 

### 

### 

### 

### **🌍 Built for Global Impact, Not Just Local Profit**

**During his travels, Travis saw the same issue in every country:**  
 **Talented people with no structured way to earn online.**  
 **At the same time, he saw small businesses being priced out of digital growth.**

**“I met people with more drive and discipline than anyone I'd worked with — but they had no path to participate. That’s when I knew: we don’t need more tools, we need fair systems.”**

**PageOne was born from that mission:**

* **Empower reps anywhere in the world to onboard clients and earn real residual income**

* **Launch pages and campaigns that actually drive results — not just look nice**

* **Create a compensation model that scales with humans, not against them**

---

### **💼 Fundraising Experience**

* **Managed campaign comms, token strategy, and brand building**

* **Handled Telegram/Discord growth and global investor engagement**

* **Operated inside a multi-team, time-sensitive raise environment**

**It gave him firsthand insight into high-pressure capital deployment, messaging, and global traction building — skills now being applied to PageOne.**

 **People who want to earn a living helping others succeed.**  
 **People who believe digital tools should serve humans — not replace them.**

**Our long-term vision is to become the default launchpad for service-based businesses across Australia, the UK, and the US, while enabling a new type of income model powered by local people, not corporate overhead.**

**We call them ambassadors — but they’re more than reps.**  
 **They’re trusted guides, system activators, and digital allies in the small business economy.**
